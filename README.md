# DGIM 2530 â€“ Slot Machine Assignment

## Required Modifications
For your version of the Slot Machine, you must make the following seven modifications:

1. **Credits Scene**: There is currently no credits scene. Create a scene named `credits`. Ensure that the buttons on the first splash scene and the summary scene navigate to the credits scene when clicked. Customize the credits scene to your liking, drawing inspiration from the memory credits scene. Include a button that takes the user back to the splash scene.
2. **Logo Replacement**: Replace the "Super Seven Slot Mania" logo and animation on the splash, splash2, and summary scenes with a custom logo that fits your chosen theme. For theme ideas, consider common, non-trademark themes like Greek Mythology, Norse Mythology, The Wild West, or specific animals. Create your own animation to replace the spinning poker chips in the original splash scene.
3. **Image Replacement**: Substitute the images in `strip1.png` with ones that match your selected theme. Refer to `stripOverlay.png` for layout guidance. Use images from resources like flaticon.com, Creative Commons, or create your own. Credit any Creative Commons images in the credits scene.
4. **PayTable Modification**: Update the `payTable` image in splash2 and the main scene to reflect your new thematic images. The "winning" icons should replace the seven icon and the cherry icon.
5. **UI Updates**: Change the fonts, colors, and background images of buttons and other UI elements in the main scene.
6. **Usability Tests**: Conduct two usability tests with different individuals using the provided sheet. Record their feedback.
7. **GitHub Hosting**: Host your project on GitHub following the provided procedure.

## Optional Modifications (Choose at least 2)
- Modify the animations for smallWins and bigWins to be different from the "toggleBackground" function.
- Replace the blue "I" icon for the payTable and the "cashOut" icons with your own images.
- Create new audio files for badBeep, bigWin, and smallWin using tools like GarageBand or chiptone.
- Add a background audio file that plays and loops in the main scene, stopping on "On Page Unload". Credit the author in the credits scene.
- Adjust the Javascript code to change the winning and losing probabilities.
- Introduce additional code, audio, or graphic resources not listed above.

## Usability Section
Conduct each survey with yourself and one user. Select individuals from varying backgrounds. After completion, note your observations on user reactions and suggestions for game improvement. Save the document as `Usability-Survey-Slots-STUDENT-USER.docx`, substituting STUDENT and USER with the respective names.
